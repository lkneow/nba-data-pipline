## Notes
- `AIRFLOW_UID` is set to 1000
- will have to run `mkdir -p ./dags ./logs ./plugins`
- use [`.env_example`](.env_example) to make a `.env`
- Note the airflow and gcloud sdk version in [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)
    - pip moved to after AIRFLOW_UID since it can't run with root?
- Note the location of creds in [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml)

## Credentials
There is a creds folder with service account credentials as google_credentials.json
